### Solution
- Hash map to count the characters and to group them together
    - Counts of characters with the same value will be grouped together
- Use the count as the key of the hash map
- Default dictionary so we can make a hash table of lists 
- 26 size array to store the count
    - char - ascii value of a to get the value in the array
- Time complexity O(m * n)
